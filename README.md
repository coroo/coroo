### Hi, Kuncoro here ðŸ¦˜

A software engineer with more than 8 years of experience in architecture design & engineering, microservices, and programming.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working at one of the insurance in Indonesia to built an insurtech. Why insurtech? Because of this fun fact ðŸ‘‡:

âš¡ Fun fact: 
There is a wide range of innovations being explored in this industry. In 2018, 30 percent of insurance companies were already using or considering using robotic process automation (RPA) to review claims. However, no insurers were already using RPA for underwriting processes. Underwriting automation means that the process of evaluating the risk of insuring a client will be performed by a computer, rather than a person. 

ðŸ¤” So That:
There is still plenty of room for growth, because very few insurers have mastered how to integrate this innovation into their business models.

In living with it, I learned and build some stuff behind the scene ðŸ¤« , there are:

- [Laravel Nova Chart Dashboard](https://coroo.github.io/nova-chartjs/) - A simple chart that you can easily use in Laravel Nova.
- [Katalon & Robot Framework](https://medium.com/@coroo.wicaksono/fast-automated-testing-with-katalon-and-robot-framework-579b5bf00) - Fast Automated Testing
- ... and lastly, here we go, my Github account ðŸ‘‡
